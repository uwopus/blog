We attached a marker and tried out moving up, down, left, right and organic shapes using the Pro Controller. Our bot is able to make vertical lines successfully, but horizontal lines are more difficult (it tends to keep tilting diagonally downwards). We will have to figure out an algorithm to create horizontal lines.</p><p><img src=/blog/WebApp/prototype_test_3.png alt=WebAppScreenshots></p><h2 id=next-steps>Next Steps</h2><ul><li>Improve horizontal line functionality</li></ul></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=https://uwopus.github.io/blog/posts/prototypetest2/><span>Prototype Test 2</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://uwopus.github.io/blog/>Opus Build Blog: Autonomous Mural Painting Robot</a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p><p><a href=https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper rel=noopener target=_blank>Paper 5.1</a></p></footer></body></html>
