This week, we were able to attain a portable whiteboard thanks to Julia's mom being a teacher. We attached the robot to the whiteboard by tying the strings to C-clamps attached at the top of the whiteboard frame. 
We attached a marker and tried out moving up, down, left, right and organic shapes using the Pro Controller. Our bot is able to make vertical lines successfully, but horizontal lines are more difficult (it tends to keep tilting diagonally downwards). We will have to figure out an algorithm to create horizontal lines.
