This is significantly larger in the x-y plane than the 3D printer allows (220mm x 220mm). Two finished prints are shown in the figure below. Note the mismatch between wall thickness due to the printer not printing perfectly perpendicular to the build plate.</p><p><img src=/blog/images/mech1/partingLine.jpg alt=partingLine></p><p>Additionally, these prints took about 30hrs each. Evidently a redesign is needed to shorten manufacturing time to allow revisions. This will also increase the total print area of the robot allowing a smaller demo board to be used. These revisions should primarily focus on reorienting the motors and spray can which will affect the control model of the robot. The current CAD model at the end of this week is shown in the figure below.</p><p><img src=/blog/images/mech1/prototype2.png alt=Prototype2></p></section><nav class=post-nav>
