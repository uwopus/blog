The boards came! Some surface finish issues but overall look pretty good, did some basic short tests and everything checked out. They were ridiculously cheap, $8 for 10 main boards and 5 pico connection boards.

We made a few mistakes with the Digikey Order here, the fuse holders were different than the chosen footprints so they could not be populated. Also, the inductor was really hard to put on:

Since the footprint was almost completely underneath the component, the only way to solder this component is with a hot air gun. This was an oversight in the design phase and leaded solder needed to be used to secure the inductor as it has a lower melting point. 

The boards will be revisited once the break is over.
