Because we are not permitted to use spraypaint in the symposium building, we had to pivot to use markers instead of paint. This will still be a viable proof of concept without the safety issues of using aerosol cans indoors. 
This week, we made a new testing rig with a bigger canvas and a marker, and connected a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller to be able to easily control Op√ºs.
